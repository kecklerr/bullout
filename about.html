<p>
The Singles Steel League was started to allow strong players to compete with other strong players.  
This helped develop their dart skills.  Strategy and X01 outs was discussed to reinforce proper strategy and outs.
However, this should not just be for the strong players but for all dart players wanting to deveop their skills.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Steel tip play requires knowledge of X01 outs and strategy of Cricket play in order to win.  While there are several 
web sites that discuss this, nothing drives the force of that knowledge than actual play.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The League still wants to pit strong players against other strong players.  This is why we are using the ELO ranking system.
This allows ranked players to know the strength of play of other ranked players.  The more players that get ranked the more accurate the 
overall league rankings will be. As more players get ranked we can setup uniformed division to promote equal battles that require proper startegy and outs knowledge.
